# Decission_Tree_on_small_dataset
Required Python libraries (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn)
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script provided in this repository to perform the following steps:

Data cleaning and preprocessing
Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
Training a Decision Tree Classifier
Making predictions on the test set
Calculating accuracy
The project uses a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether passengers survived the Titanic disaster.
The accuracy of the model on the test set is displayed in the console when running the code.
